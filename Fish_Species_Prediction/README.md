###Fish Species Prediction Model and Webpage
This project includes a machine learning model trained to predict fish species based on various features and a frontend webpage where users can input these features to get predictions.

###Model
The machine learning model is trained using a RandomForestClassifier with 100 estimators and a random state of 0. It is trained on the Fish Market dataset, which contains information about common fish species in the market. 

###Frontend Webpage
The frontend webpage is built using HTML and CSS. It provides a simple form where users can input features such as weight, length, height, etc., and get predictions for the fish species based on the trained model.

####Usage
Saved the trained model using pickle.
Hosted the model on a server (e.g., Heroku).
Update the frontend webpage to send input data to the hosted model's API endpoint.
